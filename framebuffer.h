/* Design Notes:
 *
 * This buffer contains canfd_frames received by CANThread or
 * UDPThread and stores them in a queue until an event occurs that leads to
 * flushing the buffer (e.g. timeout in UDPThread).
 *
 * When this happens, the buffers will be swapped to minimize the
 * time a Thread can be locked by a mutex.
 * All sorting should take place on the intermediate buffer to make
 * the whole operation as non-blocking as possible for the producer thread.
 *
 * Only the intermediate buffer is exposed and should only be accessed
 * by one party at a time.
 *
 * If the producer is a lot faster than the receiver, in our case
 * UDPThread >> CANThread, frames can also be extracted one at a time
 * if the interface blocks and writing is deferred.
 *
 * Currently there are a lot of mutex locks involved which need to be checked
 * again at a later time.
 *
 * The goal is to have FrameBuffer 100% thread-safe to support further
 * use-cases of cannelloni.
